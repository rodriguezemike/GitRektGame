# GitRekt

GitRekt is a turned-based combat game inspired by classic titles like Pok√©mon. This project is a showcase of academic game development, demonstrating various game development concepts, including combat state machines, AI interactions, inventory systems, map systems, and cutscenes. 

**Note:** This project is archived and is no longer in active development. Contributions will not be accepted. It exists purely for educational purposes and to showcase game development code.

## Features

- **Turn-based Combat:** Players engage in strategic battles with AI-controlled enemies, where each turn allows for action choices based on available resources and attacks.
- **Combat State Machine:** A robust state machine is used to manage the various phases of combat, such as player turns, enemy turns, and transition states.
- **AI Enemy Interaction:** The AI is designed to interact intelligently during combat, providing a challenge to players through various tactics and strategies.
- **Inventory System:** Players can collect, manage, and use items that impact the game world or aid in combat.
- **Map System:** The game features an explorable map that the player can navigate, including interactions with NPCs, enemies, and items.
- **Cutscenes:** Story-driven cutscenes are integrated into the game to progress the narrative and immerse players in the game world.

## Game Design

The game is structured around several key systems:

1. **Combat State Machine:** The game handles combat by managing a finite set of states such as 'Player Turn', 'Enemy Turn', and 'Battle End'. Transitions between these states are triggered based on player and enemy actions.

2. **Inventory System:** Items are tracked in the player's inventory and can be used in combat or throughout the game world. Each item has a specific use or effect, such as healing or enhancing abilities.

3. **Map System:** The game world is divided into various areas, and the player navigates these areas to encounter enemies, find items, and interact with NPCs.

4. **Cutscenes:** A sequence of scripted events that unfold during key moments in the game. These are used to advance the narrative and deepen the player's engagement.
